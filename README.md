Iâ€™m a doctoral researcher in musicology at the University of Helsinki looking for job opportunities in the fields of Business Intelligence and data analysis.

I'm currently learning Python, Java, Go, Django, Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS. Also, I've been creating websites with Ghost and WordPress.
